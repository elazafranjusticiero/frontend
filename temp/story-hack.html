                    <p class="7">An estimated 400-1,200 patients died as a result of poor care over the 50 months between January 2005 and March 2009 at Stafford hospital, a small district general hospital in Staffordshire. The report being published on 6 February 2013 of the public inquiry chaired by Robert Francis QC will be the fifth official report into the scandal since 2009, and Francis's second into the hospital's failings.</p>

The government deserves credit for holding the public inquiry, which was stubbornly refused by its predecessor. However, for its potential to be realised, Jeremy Hunt will have to put patient safety before politics and commit to implementing the recommendations in full. Not to do so would be a betrayal of patients and the NHS itself.</p>

That was just after Julie Bailey, whose 86-year-old mother Bella died there as a result of poor care, inadvertently kickstarted exposure of what became the Mid Staffs scandal by convening a public meeting for anyone who had had a similar experience. But the NHS trust mentioned above is the one that runs both Cheltenham general and Gloucestershire royal hospitals, and the consultant went public with his claims on BBC Radio Gloucestershire just last week.</p>

The mammoth public inquiry was chaired by Robert Francis QC, right, described by solicitors who hire him as "formidable" and "forensically exceptional". A barrister specialising in the NHS and medical negligence, he is highly skilled at getting to the truth and quietly scathing when he feels censure is due.</p>
